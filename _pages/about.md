Hello! I'm a fourth-year Physics student at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in astrophysics, specifically in the theoretical and computational study of cosmological simulations, as well as stellar and galactic dynamics. I have conducted research under Professor [Rupert Croft](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/croft.html), and I am currently advised by Professor [Hy Trac](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/trac.html).

I was born in San Jose, California, but mostly grew up in Alpharetta, Georgia. My parents are from India.

Feel free to reach out at jayanthktumuluri[at]gmail[dot]com for any inquiries!
