Hello! I'm an incoming Physics Master's student at Northwestern University. I graduated in Spring 2024 with a Bachelor's in Physics/Astrophysics Track. While there, I have conducted research under Professor [Rupert Croft](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/croft.html) and Professor [Hy Trac](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/trac.html), both in cosmological simulations. I am interested in stellar and galactic dynamics, as well as gravitational wave research, and I am currently exploring different research topics at Northwestern.

I was born in San Jose, California, but mostly grew up in Alpharetta, Georgia.
